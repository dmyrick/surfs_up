# Surfs_Up

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the temperature trends in June and December in Oahu, Hawaii before opening a new surf shop. The data was analyzed to determine if a new surf and ice cream shop business would be sustainable year-round.

## Results
From the analysis, the following could be concluded, which is represented in the images below for June and December:
  1. The mean temperature for June was 75 degrees and December 71 degrees.
  2. The June count for the temperatures in the data contained 183 more values than the count for the temperatures in December. An additional analysis could show that the established stations were closed more often in December due to the weather or the holidays, which could impact the new business. 
  3. The max temperature in June was 85 degrees and 83 degrees in December.

Therefore, additional queries could be performed to gather more weather data for June and December. The queries are the following:
  1. Determine the amount of precipitation or other severe weather conditions in the month of June and December to analyze the impact on the new business.
  2. Determine the summary statistics of temperatures for the stations located in Oahu. The temperatures by the geographical region of the stations could guide the decision of where to build the new shop.
